    <h1>Summer Swim Camps</h1>

    <h1>Building Swimming Skills All Summer Long</h1>

    <p>If your child is between the ages of 5 to 14 and can swim two lengths across a 25 yard pool unassisted, consider enrolling them in our summer swim camps. Splashes Aquatics summer swim camps are held weekly throughout the summer. Discounts are also available for students who enroll in three sessions or more.</p>

    <p>During the day, students will work with our highly qualified instructors on stroke technique, breathing, starts and turns, along with speed work. In the middle of the day, we provide students with a snack and beverage. Swim games will be run during the last 30-45 minutes of each daily session for the children to enjoy our rafts and pool toys.</p>
